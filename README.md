# Bembers-Music
Bembers-Music is a simple audio player for android that plays mp3s stored on the phone.
It lets you skip, shuffle and loop the songs.
Works in the backgroud and lets you control the songs using notification, as well as buttons on the connected devices (i.e. buttons on headphones).

It was made using Exoplayer and media service.

Feel free to use the code or the app itself.
